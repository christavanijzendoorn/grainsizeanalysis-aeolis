# Grain Size Analysis - AeoLiS

This repository contains the Python code that was used to analyze grain size scenarios presented in:
- Chapter 5 in van IJzendoorn, C. (2023). From loose grains to resilient dunes.
- van IJzendoorn, C. O., Hallin, C., Reniers, A. J. H. M., & de Vries, S. (2023). Modeling Multi‐Fraction Coastal Aeolian Sediment Transport With Horizontal and Vertical Grain‐Size Variability. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 128(7), e2023JF007155.

Go through the following steps to reproduce the figures in that publication:
- Download AeoLiS v2.1.0 from https://doi.org/10.4121/22215562
- Create an environment with Python 3.8 and install AeoLiS v2.1.0
- Install the content of the grainsizeanalysis-repository
- Use an IDE of your preference and run the text files in each scenario folder with the run_folder_content.py script.
- Use the .py-files in the analysis folder to create the figures that correspond to the different scenarios
